Project:   Online Bookstore System
Objective: Develop a simple online bookstore system that allows users to browse books, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout. The system should handle basic inventory management and provide a summary of the user's order.

Features:

1-Book Inventory:
Maintain a list of books with details such as title, author, price, and quantity available. Display the available books to the user.


2-User Interaction:
Ask the user to select books by entering book IDs and quantities. Add the selected books to a shopping cart.

3-Arithmetic Operators:
Calculate the total cost of the books in the shopping cart, including any applicable taxes or discounts.

4-Logical Operators:
Implement logic to check if a selected book is in stock. If not, inform the user.

5-Comparison Operators:
Compare the total cost of the order with a predefined minimum order amount. If the order is below the minimum, apply a handling fee.

6-Print Statements:
Display a summary of the user's order, including selected books, quantities, total cost, and any additional fees.
